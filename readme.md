# ESP32-P4 MIPI DSI LCD Demo

This project demonstrates how to initialize and drive a **1280√ó720 MIPI DSI LCD panel** using an **ESP32-P4** development kit with **PSRAM enabled** and **MIPI DPI + DSI interface**.

It includes:
- Powering the MIPI DSI PHY via LDO
- Setting up the DSI bus and DBI interface
- Initializing the LCD panel
- Drawing a software-generated color bar
- Displaying a hardware color pattern

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- **ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT**
- **Waveshare MIPI DSI 7" LCD (or similar)**
- ESP-IDF **v5.2 or later**
- LCD resolution: `1280x720`
- External **PSRAM** enabled
- Sufficient **I2C and GPIO** wiring if required for initialization
- LCD backlight control (optional)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Ensure the following are enabled in `menuconfig`:

Component config ‚Üí
ESP System Settings ‚Üí
[*] Support for external, SPI-connected RAM


Also verify:
- PSRAM is large enough for framebuffer(s)
- Pixel clock isn't too high for PSRAM (‚â§ 40 MHz recommended)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pin Definitions

| Signal       | GPIO   |
|--------------|--------|
| LCD RESET    | -1 (disabled) or GPIO27 |
| Backlight    | -1 (disabled) |
| I2C SDA/SCL  | GPIO7 / GPIO8 (by default) |

Adjust as needed in your project configuration.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `test_init_lcd()`  
  Initializes LDO, MIPI DSI bus, DBI IO, and the LCD panel.

- `test_draw_color_bar()`  
  Draws a vertical color bar using software rendering.

- `app_main()`  
  Entry point: initializes LCD, shows hardware and software color bars, then deinitializes.

---

## üí° Notes

- The framebuffer is allocated in **PSRAM** using `heap_caps_calloc()` with `MALLOC_CAP_DMA`.
- A **refresh semaphore** ensures synchronization between software rendering and DPI refresh.
- **Double buffering** is supported but not explicitly enabled in this example.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Display Output

The program:
1. Initializes the panel and turns it on
2. Shows a hardware-drawn horizontal color bar pattern
3. Then shows a custom-drawn software color bar using DMA
4. Waits a few seconds before deinitializing

---

## üö´ Known Issues

- If pixel clock (`pclk_hz`) is too high, **DMA underruns** will occur.
- Ensure `.psram_trans_align` and buffer alignment are correct.
- DSI configuration must match the panel datasheet (number of lanes, timings, etc.).

## üß™ Optional Features to Try

- Pixel-by-pixel test (uncomment in `app_main`)
- Double framebuffer (`.num_frame_buffers = 2`)
- Use `esp_cache_msync()` when drawing from PSRAM directly
